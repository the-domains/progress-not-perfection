"We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection."

This is a space for one sober alcoholic to share thoughts and reflections on the practice of getting and staying sober. 

Since September 1993 I have not found it necessary to take a drink or use a drug. I thank God and the program of Alcoholics Anonymous for that. 

From time to time I like to share what I have learned. There is a lot of progress I have yet to make, but I have experienced one or two things along the way. My intent is that this site may be useful to other alcoholics.

Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of the Traditions, and so I intend to remain anonymous. I will try to follow the Traditions as I develop these essays.
